# Text classification

The task concentrates on content-based text the classification.


## Tasks

1. Divide the set of bills into two exclusive sets:
   1. the set of bills amending other bills (their title starts with `o zmianie ustawy`),
   1. the set of bills not amending other bills.
1. Change the contents of the bill by removing the date of publication and the title (so the words `o zmianie ustawy`
   are removed).
1. Split the sets of documents into the following groups by randomly selecting the documents:
   1. 60% training
   1. 20% validation
   1. 20% testing
1. Do not change these groups during the following experiments.
1. Prepare the following variants of the documents:
   1. full text of the document
   1. randomly selected 10% of the lines of the document
   1. randomly selected 10 lines of the document
   1. randomly selected 1 line of the document
1. Train the following classifiers on the documents:
   1. SVM with TF•IDF
   1. Fasttext
   1. Flair with Polish language model
1. Report Precision, Recall and F1 for each variant of the experiment (12 variants altogether).


## Hints


1. Application of SVM classifier with TF•IDF is described in 
   [David Batista](http://www.davidsbatista.net/blog/2017/04/01/document_classification/) blog post.
1. [Fasttext](https://fasttext.cc/) is a popular basline classifier. Don't report the Precision/Recall/F1 provided by
   Fasttext since they might be [wrong](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/issues/261).
1. [Flair](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-classification-with-state-of-the-art-nlp-library-flair-b541d7add21f) 
   is another library for text processing. Flair classification is based on a language model.
1. [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/) by Jurafsky and Martin 
   has a [chapter](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/4.pdf) devoted to the problem of classification.
